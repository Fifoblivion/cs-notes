    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of **associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods**\n",
    "* Unlike conventional source code comments, the docstring should **describe what the function does, not how**\n",
    "* Such a docstring becomes the `__doc__` special attribute of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All modules\n",
    "2. All functions and classes exported by a module \n",
    "3. Public methods (including the `__init__` constructor)\n",
    "4. A package may be documented in the module docstring of the `__init__.py` file in the package directory\n",
    "\n",
    "* String literals occurring elsewhere in Python code may also act as documentation. \n",
    "* But **not recognized** by the Python bytecode compiler and are not accessible as runtime object attributes (i.e. `__doc__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How\n",
    "\n",
    "* For consistency, always use `\"\"\"triple double quotes\"\"\"` around docstrings\n",
    "* Use `r\"\"\"raw triple double quotes\"\"\"` if you use any backslashes in your docstrings\n",
    "* Unicode docstrings, use `u\"\"\"Unicode triple-quoted strings\"\"\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-line Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "* Triple quotes are used even though the string fits on one line. This makes it easy to later expand it.\n",
    "* The closing quotes are on the same line as the opening quotes. This looks better for one-liners.\n",
    "* There's no blank line either before or after the docstring.\n",
    "* The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. \n",
    "* It prescribes the function or method's effect as a **command** (\"Do this\", \"Return that\"), not as a description; e.g. don't write \"Returns the pathname ...\".\n",
    "* E.g.:"
